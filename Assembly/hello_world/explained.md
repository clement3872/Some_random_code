Here is an explanation of the code.

```asm
section .data
    hello_msg: db 'Hello, World!',0xA   ; 'Hello, World!' followed by a newline character
    hello_len: equ $ - hello_msg        ; Calculate the length of the string
```

- `section .data`: This directive tells the assembler to start a data section. The data section is used for declaring initialized data or constants.
- `hello_msg: db 'Hello, World!',0xA`: This line declares a label `hello_msg` that points to the data bytes that follow. `db` stands for "define bytes" and is used to store the byte sequence in memory. The string "Hello, World!" is followed by `0xA` (hexadecimal notation for a newline character, or line feed).
- `hello_len: equ $ - hello_msg`: This line declares a constant `hello_len`. `equ` stands for "equate" and sets `hello_len` to the size of the string. `$` represents the current location in the assembly output, so `$ - hello_msg` computes the number of bytes from `hello_msg` to the current position, effectively calculating the length of the string.

```asm
section .text
    global _start
```

- `section .text`: This directive starts the text section, which is where the code (instructions) is written.
- `global _start`: This makes the `_start` label accessible outside this file, which is necessary because `_start` is where the program execution begins by default in Linux without a C runtime.

```asm
_start:
    mov eax, 4                  ; The system call for write (sys_write)
    mov ebx, 1                  ; File descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov ecx, hello_msg          ; Pointer to the message to write
    mov edx, hello_len          ; Message length
    int 0x80                    ; Call kernel
```

- `_start:`: This label marks the beginning of the executable code.
- `mov eax, 4`: Moves the value `4` into the `eax` register. The value `4` is the system call number for the `write` system call in Linux 32-bit systems.
- `mov ebx, 1`: Moves the value `1` into the `ebx` register, which specifies the file descriptor. `1` is standard output (stdout).
- `mov ecx, hello_msg`: Moves the address of the `hello_msg` data into the `ecx` register. This register will now point to the string to be printed.
- `mov edx, hello_len`: Moves the length of the string (calculated earlier) into the `edx` register.
- `int 0x80`: This instruction interrupts and switches execution to the kernel (system call). It uses the values in the registers (`eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, `edx`) to perform the system call specified by `eax` (in this case, `write`).

```asm
    mov eax, 1                  ; System call for exit (sys_exit)
    xor ebx, ebx                ; Return 0 status
    int 0x80                    ; Call kernel
```

- `mov eax, 1`: Moves the value `1` into the `eax` register, specifying the `exit` system call.
- `xor ebx, ebx`: Clears the `ebx` register by XORing it with itself, effectively setting it to `0`. This value is used as the exit status of the program. `xor` is often used to set registers to zero because it is shorter and sometimes faster than loading the value directly.
- `int 0x80`: Again, this interrupts and transfers control to the kernel to handle the exit system call, effectively terminating the program.

This assembly code is a straightforward example of using Linux system calls directly through assembly for educational purposes, showcasing how lower-level interactions with an operating system can be managed.
